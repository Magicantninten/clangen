		"Some of the less sympathetic cats of c_n would prefer to try to hack up a hairball, rather than watch m_c and r_c melt in each others' direction. New mates can be insufferable.",
		"The more romantic members of the Clan sigh, watching the new mates m_c and r_c, who're too caught up in each other to notice.",
		"In a bright spot this moon, m_c and r_c have finally announced their commitment as mates.",
		"Their love has been a slow basking warmth, not a wildfire, and m_c wouldn't change it for the world. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} so excited to commit to padding at r_c's side forever.",
		"It's neither a mystery nor a surprise, but c_n is happy to celebrate m_c and r_c becoming mates regardless.",
		"m_c and r_c announce they've become mates in the least showy way possible, by combining their nests into one.",
		"There's such happiness in the promises they make to each other. m_c and r_c leap into their new life as mates without question or hesitation.",
		"For just this one perfect moment, heads pressed together and speaking their commitment in front of the Clan, there's nothing in m_c and r_c's worlds but love.",
		"m_c and r_c are very proud to announce their new status as mates - it's quite cute.",
		"Under a sliver of moonlight, m_c looks at r_c, caught in {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} dazzling pelt yet again. r_c blinks at m_c, and blurts out a confession involuntarily, quickly hitting {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} paws over {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} mouth. m_c drapes {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} tail against r_c's fur, purring that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/feel/feels} the same way. They stargaze all throughout the night, whispering sweet nothings in each others' ears. The next day, c_n is well aware of their mateship, as m_c and r_c sit in the clearing, sharing tongues and purring at each other.",
        "m_c and r_c have been eyeing each other for a while, and c_n knows it. No one, absolutely no one, is surprised when m_c declares their mateship, and the Clan even looks forward to finding them doing romantic, couple-y things in the future.",
        "Waiting under a long, strewn willow tree, m_c's eyes glisten when r_c stumbles into view, fur puffed up and face flushed. m_c pads forward, escaping the shade of the tree, purring that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} glad to see r_c. r_c looks away, stifling a purr, and {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/sit/sits} down at the roots of the tree. m_c pushes a thrush to r_c's paws, and r_c offers to share. They eat, and after finishing the prey m_c finally confesses. r_c twirls {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} tail with m_c's, headbutting {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} neck lightly and confessing that {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/feel/feels} the same way. Together they return to camp, feeling the suspicious gazes of their fellow warriors.",

Flustered and worried, r_c nervously admits {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} reciprocation with a laugh, and m_c forces {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} fur to lie flat, smiling at r_c.",
        "Far too agonizing is the weight of m_c's love for r_c, the daydreams of being with {PRONOUN/r_c/object} - and now, it's finally reality, with r_c's breath hot against m_c's pelt, curled up together in a rabbit burrow in what was supposed to be a hunting patrol.",
        "m_c finishes {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} confession, and proceeds to gush about how beautiful and popular r_c is, and how {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} couldn't compare - but r_c meows that no way, m_c is way more pretty and loved by the Clan, and how r_c felt the same way. They stand in silence for a while, before settling at a slope to watch the mellow sunset.",
